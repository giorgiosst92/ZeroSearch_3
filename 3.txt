Run this code with python3, to install and run use the following commands:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 zero_binary_search.py


Note: change the value stored inside [processing].[input] in the config.ini file in order
to test different scenarios


At the end you will get a print in the console telling:

Binary conversion: 10010000100001110000000
The largest number of consecutive 0s surrounded by 1s:  4


The logic is pretty basic, since every binary number by default start with 1, the only value
that needs to be checked is the last one, just to be sure that the biggest sequence of zeroes
that reside in the end is also surrounded by 1s.
